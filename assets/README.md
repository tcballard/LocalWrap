# LocalWrap Assets

This directory should contain the following icon files for LocalWrap:

## Required Icons

- `icon.png` - Main app icon (256x256 pixels)
- `icon.ico` - Windows icon (multi-size)
- `icon.icns` - macOS icon (multi-size) 
- `tray-icon.png` - System tray icon (16x16 or 32x32 pixels)

## Icon Guidelines

- Use consistent branding across all icons
- Ensure good visibility at small sizes
- Test tray icon visibility in both light and dark themes
- Follow platform-specific icon guidelines

## Temporary Solution

Until custom icons are created, the app will use Electron's default icon.
This is functional but not ideal for production distribution.

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
- Online icon generators
- Design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe Illustrator
- Icon conversion tools for different formats
