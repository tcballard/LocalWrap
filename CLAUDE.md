This document outlines the comprehensive transformation of LocalWrap from a CLI-based development tool into a user-friendly, monetizable MicroSaaS product. The goal is to create a desktop application that allows users to easily configure and view multiple localhost development servers through an intuitive graphical interface, eliminating the need for command-line operations.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Strengths
- **Solid Foundation**: Electron-based desktop application with Express server
- **Security Features**: CSP headers, rate limiting, input validation, context isolation
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux support
- **System Tray Integration**: Minimize to tray functionality
- **Server Management API**: RESTful endpoints for server control
- **Multi-Server Support**: Can manage multiple ports simultaneously

### Current Limitations
- **Limited Configuration**: No persistent settings or user preferences
- **No Monetization**: Free MIT license with no revenue model
- **Basic Functionality**: Minimal features beyond basic server management
- **No User Accounts**: No way to track usage or provide premium features
- **No Project Organization**: Servers aren't grouped or categorized

## Target State Vision

### User Experience Goals
1. **Zero CLI Required**: Complete graphical interface for all operations
2. **Intuitive Configuration**: Visual port management with Windows 95-style controls
3. **Retro UI/UX**: Maintain the classic Windows 95 aesthetic as a unique brand identity
4. **Persistent Settings**: Remember user preferences and server configurations
5. **Quick Setup**: One-click installation and configuration

### Business Model
2. **Subscription Tiers**: Monthly/yearly plans with different feature sets
